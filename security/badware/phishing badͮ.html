<h1>Phishing page</h1>

<p>This is an example phishing page that DuckDuckGo clients intend to block. The URL here uses uncommon escape sequences for UTF-16 characters to test how our browsers protect against them. If you arrive here by mistake; there's nothing to worry about, we just use this page to test if our client blocking is working.</p>
